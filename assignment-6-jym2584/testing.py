    Compares the expected and actual floating point values to see if the two

            expected: The expected value. Must be int or float.
            actual: The actual value. Must be int or float.
            threshold: The maximum amount by which the two values may differ
                and still be considered to be equivalent. Default value is 
                0.05.
